CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "oboe" with any of
  the following names:

    oboeConfig.cmake
    oboe-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "oboe" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "oboe_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "oboe"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
